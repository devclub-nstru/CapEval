### 1. Architectural Overview

The CapEval platform will follow a three-tier architecture, aligning with the goals and objectives outlined in the PRD.md document:

*   **Frontend (Presentation Tier):**
    *   **Purpose:** As defined in the PRD, the frontend will focus on providing an intuitive interface for students and faculty to interact with the platform. This includes assignment submission, evaluation viewing, and query resolution.
    *   **Key Responsibilities:**
        *   Rendering dynamic content based on user roles and permissions, as specified in the PRD's "User Roles" section.
        *   Managing user input and data validation to ensure data integrity.
        *   Communicating with the backend via API calls to handle assignment submissions, evaluations, and query management.
        *   Providing a responsive and accessible user interface, adhering to the PRD's emphasis on "Time Efficiency & Flexibility."
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   Optimize for performance to ensure smooth navigation and quick loading times, aligning with the PRD's "System Performance & Reliability" success metrics.
        *   Implement robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms to enhance user experience.
        *   Ensure cross-browser compatibility and adherence to web standards.
*   **Backend (Application Tier):**
    *   **Purpose:** The backend will serve as the application's engine, providing the necessary APIs for data management, user authentication, and AI-driven evaluations, as detailed in the PRD.
    *   **Key Responsibilities:**
        *   Handling user authentication and authorization, based on the "User Roles" defined in the PRD.
        *   Managing data access and persistence, ensuring data integrity and security.
        *   Implementing business logic and application workflows, such as assignment submission, evaluation processing, and query resolution.
        *   Processing AI-based evaluations and generating scores, as outlined in the PRD's "Evaluation & Feedback" objectives.
        *   Securing the application against common web vulnerabilities.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   Design RESTful APIs that are well-documented and easy to use.
        *   Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data.
        *   Optimize for performance and scalability to handle a large number of concurrent users.
        *   Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track system health and performance.
*   **Admin Panel (Management Tier):**
    *   **Purpose:** The admin panel will provide administrative functionalities, allowing administrators to manage users, tests, and evaluation settings, as described in the PRD's "Feature Requirements."
    *   **Key Responsibilities:**
        *   Managing user accounts and roles, as defined in the PRD's "User Roles" section.
        *   Creating, updating, and deleting tests and questions, aligning with the PRD's "Assignment Management" objectives.
        *   Configuring evaluation settings and parameters.
        *   Generating reports and analytics on test performance.
        *   Monitoring system health and performance.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   Implement a secure authentication mechanism to protect administrative access.
        *   Provide a user-friendly interface for managing system settings.
        *   Implement audit logging to track administrative actions.

### 2. Database Schema Design

The database schema will be designed to efficiently store and retrieve data related to users, tests, questions, and results. The design will support the features and requirements outlined in the PRD.md document, including assignment management, evaluation and feedback, and query resolution.

### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is crucial for ensuring that users have appropriate access levels based on their roles, as defined in the PRD's "User Roles" section.

*   **Roles:**
    *   `candidate`: Can take tests and view results.
    *   `evaluator`: Can evaluate test results and provide feedback.
    *   `admin`: Can manage users, tests, and evaluation settings.
*   **Permissions:**
    *   Each role should have specific permissions that define what actions they can perform within the system.
    *   Examples:
        *   `candidate`: `take_test`, `view_results`
        *   `evaluator`: `evaluate_test`, `provide_feedback`
        *   `admin`: `manage_users`, `manage_tests`, `manage_settings`
*   **Middleware:**
    *   Implement middleware functions to enforce RBAC at the route level.
    *   The middleware should check the user's role and permissions before allowing access to a specific route.

### 4. Scalability and Security Improvements

*   **Scalability:**
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple backend instances to prevent overload.
    *   **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
    *   **Database Optimization:** Optimize database queries and indexing to improve performance.
    *   **Queueing System:** Use a queueing system for handling asynchronous tasks like AI-based evaluations.
    *   **Horizontal Scaling:** Design the application to be horizontally scalable, allowing you to add more instances as needed.
*   **Security:**
    *   **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS to encrypt all traffic.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
    *   **2FA:** Implement two-factor authentication for admin accounts.
    *   **CORS:** Configure CORS properly to prevent cross-origin request attacks.
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep all dependencies up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.

### 5. Best Practices and Enhancements

*   **AI-Based Evaluation Engine:**
    *   Utilize NLP techniques to analyze essay-type answers.
    *   Implement machine learning models to predict candidate performance.
    *   Provide explainable AI to justify evaluation scores.
    *   Continuously train and improve the AI models based on feedback and data.
*   **Real-time Collaboration:**
    *   Implement real-time collaboration features for evaluators to discuss results.
    *   Use technologies like WebSockets to enable real-time communication.
*   **Integration with HR Systems:**
    *   Enable integration with existing HR systems for seamless data transfer.
    *   Use APIs to exchange data between CapEval and HR systems.
*   **Gamification:**
    *   Incorporate gamification elements to increase candidate engagement.
    *   Examples: points, badges, leaderboards.
*   **Accessibility:**
    *   Ensure the platform is accessible to users with disabilities (WCAG compliance).
    *   Use semantic HTML, provide alternative text for images, and ensure keyboard navigation.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track system performance and errors.
    *   Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
    *   Use logging libraries to record application events and errors.
*   **Microservices Architecture:**
    *   Consider breaking down the backend into microservices for improved scalability and maintainability.
    *   Each microservice can be responsible for a specific function, such as user authentication, test management, or AI-based evaluation.
