# CapEval

In college, submitting and evaluating assignments or projects can be cumbersome for both students and faculty. Moreover, addressing student queries often requires synchronous communication, which is not always feasible. **CapEval** streamlines the assignment lifecycle ‚Äî from creation and submission to evaluation ‚Äî while offering an intuitive interface for query resolution. This platform reduces real-time interaction, enabling both parties to engage at their convenience.
